    <h2>History</h2>
    <img src="Images/History/Ancient_Greek_Football_Player.jpg" alt="Greek Football player" class="GreekFootPlayer">
    <p>Through the centuries there have been many variations of sports that echo the origins of what soccer is today. In Ancient Mesoamerican cultures, they would play with a ball made of rock that symbolized the sun. The captain of the losing team would then be sacrificed to the gods. In the 2nd and 3rd century a game called Cuju was known to be played in China. This involved played with a round ball on a square field, it was later spread to Japan and practiced in ceremonial forms. The Ancient Greeks and Romans were the first to implement balls made of leather and were filled with hair. However the game was not used as entertainment but as a training exercise to improve footwork.</p> 

    <p>Soccer as it is known today got its origins in 12th Century England. During that time there were a lot less rules, use of hands was legal and the sport was a lot more physical. These matches were mainly played in meadows and roads in England. Due to its violent nature, this version of the game was met with controversy and thus was banned for several centuries as it would often result in property damage, serious injury and sometimes death. It would go on to be banned in the 17th century and again in 1835. 2 schools, Rugby and Eton, continued to play the game with 2 different styles of playing. In Rugby, soccer was played with the ability to use hands, this developed into the game of Rugby known today. While in Eton it was played with only the use of your feet.</p>
