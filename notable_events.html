    <p><b><i>Soccer</i></b> is a game of passion. It is one of the games that not just connects people, the world at large too! There’s this feeling of adrenaline build up when your best player does as much as touch the ball in a moment that defines the outcome of the game.<br> 
    One of the most televised and attended football competitions of today is the World Cup. While we wait for 2022 to witness it again (and hopefully we would have moved past the pandemic), here are a few glorious, iconic, spectacular moments that shook the football world. These are the legendary goals, controversies and famous meltdowns   that will remain in the history books forever! </p>

  <br>(Click the link to see the Goal of the Century)
  </dt><br>
  <dd>Yes, the “Hand of God” was more famous – or infamous – but Diego Maradona’s second goal against England in the quarterfinals still stands as a shining example of what soccer is all about. In a span of four minutes the world saw the worst and best of Argentina’s ultimate sporting icon. While the “Hand of God” goal was the very definition of deceit, Maradona’s second goal, later dubbed “The Goal of the Century,” was pure poetry, affirmation of his genius and standing as the greatest player on the planet at the time.</dd><br>

  <br>
  <dd>Racing England goalkeeper Peter Shilton for a ball that hung in the air, the Argentine trickster punched it into the net, expertly camouflaging his trickery and duping the linesman and referee by nodding his head as if he made contact with it. At the post-match press conference, a brazen Maradona claimed the goal was scored “a little bit by the Hand of God, another bit by the head of Maradona.” TV networks around the world showed the incident time and time again that evening, as Maradona’s “Hand of God” goal became enshrined in the sporting lexicon.</dd>

  <dt><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Uhe_l1h3w8">Geoff Hurst’s - Most Debated Right-Footed Goal(1966)</a>
  <br>(Click me to watch why was this the most debated goal!)
  </dt>
  <br>
  <dd>No goal in the history of sport sparks as much controversy as Hurst’s game-winner against the West Germans in the final. In extra time, Hurst belted a furious right-footed shot that blazed past goalkeeper Hans Tilkowski, hit the underside of the crossbar and bounced down on the goal-line. Did the ball cross the line? Subsequent replays over the years show it did not, but when asked by Swiss referee Gottfried Dienst for a ruling, linesman Tofik Bakhramov, without hesitation, pointed his flag towards the centre circle on the field, signaling a goal. The Germans were livid, but England went on to win the World Cup</dd>

  <dt><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKsMnEemzMM">Pele and Carlos Alberto - The Burial of Italy (1970)</a><br>(Cick to see the highlights from this amazing game!)</dt>
  <br>
  <dd>The goal was symbolic of the attacking genius of the Brazilians who used spirit, guile and talent to vanquish the defensive Italians. It was memorable strike that capped off an emphatic 4-1 win for Brazil over Italy in the final. Pele started the move down the left side before drifting towards the middle. He found some open space and sensing Alberto was coming down the right side, he played a perfect square pass 25 yards from goal that Alberto lashed onto without breaking stride and hammered the ball past static Italian goalkeeper Enrico Albertosi. Legendary if you ask me.</dd>

  <dt><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu1WanatiAM">Uruguay silences the Maracana (1950)</a>
  <br>(Click me to watch highlights from this game!)
  </dt>
  <br>
  <dd>Buoyed by the crowd of 174,000 spectators at Rio’s Maracana stadium on a rainy day, the invincible Brazilians were virtually assured of victory against Uruguay in the tournament finale. What’s more, Uruguay had tied Spain in its first game of the final round and trailed Brazil by a point. All the hosts had to do was earn a draw against Uruguay and Brazil would be crowned world champions. How could they lose? Thanks to a brave effort, Uruguay pulled out the victory in the 79th minute when Alcides Ghiggia played a 1-2 pass with Julio Perez and beat the Brazilian goalkeeper at the near post. When the final whistle blew, the stunned and silent Maracana crowd broke into tears.</dd>

  <dt><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITdPTKpGHuI">Zidane’s head-butt (2006)</a>
  <br>(click the link to see this infamous head-but!)</dt>
  <br>
  <dd>This is one of those historical moments that was not even defined by a goal! With 10 minutes remaining in extra time of the final, Zinedine Zidane turned to face Marco Materazzi (who said something to tick off the French midfielder) and head-butted the Italian defender in the chest, knocking him to the ground and earning a red card for himself. Zidane’s act of lunacy cost France its best scorer in the shootout and Italy claimed its fourth World Cup title. A media feeding frenzy ensued – news agencies around the globe tried to find out what Materazzi said to set off Zidane – and the retiring Zizou left the game in disgrace.</dd>
