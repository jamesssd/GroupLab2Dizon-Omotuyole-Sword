  document.getElementById("articleID").innerHTML="<div class=\"soccer\"><ol id =\"Rules\"><h2>Rules of the Game</h2><li><b>The Field of Play</b></li><ol type=\"i\"><li>Soccer must be played on gross or artificial turf with proper regulation lengths.</li></ol><li><b>The Ball</b></li><ol type=\"i\"><li>A soccer ball must be spherical in shape and made of leather. The circumference must be in the range of 27 to 28 inches.</li></ol><li><b>The Number of Players</b></li><ol type=\"i\"><li>A match must be played by two teams of 11 players to each side. If a team cannot get at least seven players at match time, then that team will forfeit.</li></ol><li><b>The Player's Equipment</b></li><ol type=\"i\"><li>All players are required to wear a jersey, shorts, shin guards, socks and cleats. The socks must cover the shin guards entirely. If the referee deems a player’s equipment unsatisfactory, the player can be sent off until the issue is remedied.</li></ol><li><b>The Referee</b></li><ol type=\"i\"><li>The RefereeThe referee is the authority on the field, and his word is law. If you question a referee’s decision, you can be disciplined further simply for dissent.</li></ol><li><b>The Assistant Referees</b></li><ol type=\"i\"><li>The assistant referees are primarily responsible for assisting the referee in performing his duties – this includes signaling with a flag when a ball goes of play, when a player is fouled, or when a player is in an offside position.</li></ol><li><b>The Duration of the Match</b></li><ol type=\"i\"><li>A soccer match is comprised of two 45-minute halves, with extra time added for each at the referee’s discretion. The halves are separated by a half-time period not to exceed 15 minutes. The extra time generally corresponds with the referee’s determination of how much time was taken up due to substitutions and injuries. The amount of extra time is announced and displayed at the half line at the end of each 45-minute period. Although soccer does have an allotted time limit, it is ultimately up to the referee’s as to when to end a match.</li></ol><li><b>The Start and Restart of Play</b></li><ol type=\"i\"><li>Kick-off is generally determined by a coin toss, whereby the winning team can either choose to start with the ball or choose which goal they would like to attack. The losing team is then afforded whatever choice the winner does not elect to take. Kick-off occurs at the start of each half, and after each goal scored, and is taken at the center of the halfway line. If a team scores a goal, the opposing team is given the kick-off to restart the match.</li></ol><li><b>Ball In and Out of Play</b></li><ol type=\"i\"><li>The ball is out of play when it fully crosses either the goal line or the touch line. It is also out of play if the referee stops play for any reason. If, for any reason, the ball strikes the frame of the goal or the referee and remains within the goal and touch lines, it is still in play.</li></ol><li><b>The Method of Scoring</b></li><ol type=\"i\"><li>A goal is scored when the entire ball has crossed the goal line within the frame of the goal. At the end of the match, the team with the most goals is the winner, barring the circumstantial necessity for extra time.</li></ol><li><b>Offside</b></li><ol type=\"i\"><li>When an attacking player receives the ball while on his opponents half, he must be level or behind the second to last defender (the last typically being the goalkeeper). However, this rule only applies if he is involved with the play. To get a better understanding of the offside rule, please see the guide section for a more detailed explanation.</li></ol><li><b>Fouls and Misconduct</b></li><ol type=\"i\"><li>A direct free kick is awarded when a player:</li><ol type=\"i\"><li>Kicks or attempts to kick an opponent</li><li>Trips or attempts to trip an opponent</li><li>Jumps at an opponent</li><li>Charges an opponent</li><li>Strikes or attempts to strike an opponent</li><li>Pushes an opponent</li><li>Tackles an opponent</li><li>Holds an opponent</li><li>Spits at an opponent</li><li>Handles the ball deliberately</li></ol></ol><li><b>If any of these are fouls are committed by a player in their team’s penalty area, the opposing team is awarded a penalty kick. Indirect free kicks are awarded if a player:</b></li><ol type=\"i\"><li>Plays in a dangerous manner</li><li>Impedes the progress of an opponent</li><li>Prevents the goalkeeper from releasing the ball from his/her hands</li><li>Commits any other unmentioned offense</li></ol><li><b>Yellow cards are awarded as a caution or warning to a player and can be issued for the following offenses:</b></li><ol type=\"i\"><li>Unsporting behavior</li><li>Dissent by word or action</li><li>Persistent infringement of the Laws of the Game</li><li>Delaying the restart of play</li><li>Failure to respect the required distance when play is restarted with a corner kick,free kick, or throw-in</li><li>Entering or re-entering the field of play without the referee’s permission</li><li>deliberately leaving the field of play without the referee’s permission</li></ol><li><b>Red cards are used to send a player off the field, and can be issued for the following offenses:</b></li><ol type=\"i\"><li>Serious foul play</li><li>Violent conduct</li><li>Spitting at an opponent or any other person</li><li>Denying the opposing team a goal or an obvious goal-scoring opportunity by deliberately handling the ball (the goalkeeper being an exception)</li><li>Denying an obvious goal-scoring opportunity to an opponent moving towards the player’s goal by an offense punishable by a free kick or a penalty kick</li><li>Using offensive or abusive language and/or gestures</li><li>Receiving a second caution (yellow card) in the same match</li></ol><li><b>Free Kicks</b></li><ol type=\"i\"><li>Free Kick is broken into two categories, direct and indirect. A direct kick can be shot directly into the opponent’s goal without touching another player. An indirect free kick is indicated by the referee raising his hand during the kick. An indirect kick can only go into the goal if it has subsequently been touched by another player before it enters the goal. The ball must be stationary for both types of kicks.</li></ol><li><b>The Penalty Kick</b></li><ol type=\"i\"><li>A penalty kick is awarded either when a defensive player fouls an attacking player or commits a handball in his/her team’s penalty area. The penalty kick is placed at the penalty spot, and all players on both teams must remain outside the penalty box during the shot. They may enter the box immediately after the shot is taken. The goalkeeper may move horizontally along the goal line before the shot is taken, but he may not come off the line until the ball is struck.</li></ol><li><b>The Throw-In</b></li><ol type=\"i\"><li>A throw-in is awarded when the possessing team plays the ball out of bounds over the touchline. While taking a throw-in, a player must release the ball with both hands simultaneously and keep both feet firmly planted on the ground. If these conditions are not met, play is stopped and the throw-in is given to the opposing team. Players are not allowed to score directly off a throw-in.</li></ol><li><b>The Goal Kick</b></li><ol type=\"i\"><li>A goal kick is awarded when the offensive team plays the ball out of bounds over the defensive team’s goal line. After the ball is out of play, the defender or goalkeeper may place the ball anywhere within the six-yard goal box and kick the ball back into play.</li></ol><li><b>The Corner Kick</b></li><ol type=\"i\"><li>A corner kick is awarded to the offensive team when the defensive team plays the ball out of bounds over its goal line. The ball is placed within the corner area and is kicked back into play by the offensive team. Players can score directly off a corner kick.</li></ol></ol></div>"

In Ancient Mesoamerican cultures, they would play with a ball made of rock that symbolized the sun. The captain of the losing team would then be sacrificed to the gods. In the 2nd and 3rd century a game called Cuju was known to be played in China. This involved played with a round ball on a square field, it was later spread to Japan and practiced in ceremonial forms. The Ancient Greeks and Romans were the first to implement balls made of leather and were filled with hair. However the game was not used as entertainment but as a training exercise to improve footwork.<br><br><img src=\"Images/History/Chinese children playing Cuju.jpg\" alt=\"Chinese children playing Cuju\" class=\"Cuju\">Soccer as it is known today got its origins in 12th Century England. During that time there were a lot less rules, use of hands was legal and the sport was a lot more physical. These matches were mainly played in meadows and roads in England. Due to its violent nature, this version of the game was met with controversy and thus was banned for several centuries as it would often result in property damage, serious injury and sometimes death. It would go on to be banned in the 17th century and again in 1835. 2 schools, Rugby and Eton, continued to play the game with 2 different styles of playing. In Rugby, soccer was played with the ability to use hands, this developed into the game of Rugby known today. While in Eton it was played with only the use of your feet.</p><h2>Evolution of Soccer</h2><ul class=\"soccer\"><li><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">5000BC-AD:</span> Games resembling soccer are played in China, Japan, Grece, Egypt and Native America.</li><br><li><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">60BC:</span>China and Japan were the first have an international game.

It is one of the games that not just connects people, the world at large too! There’s this feeling of adrenaline build up when your best player does as much as touch the ball in a moment that defines the outcome of the game.<br> One of the most televised and attended football competitions of today is the World Cup. While we wait for 2022 to witness it again (and hopefully we would have moved past the pandemic), here are a few glorious, iconic, spectacular moments that shook the football world. These are the legendary goals, controversies and famous meltdowns   that will remain in the history books forever! </p><div id=\"ne_links\"><dt><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wVho3I0NtU\">Diego Maradona - Goal of the Century(1986)</a><br>(Click the link to see the Goal of the Century)</dt><br><dd>Yes, the “Hand of God” was more famous – or infamous – but Diego Maradona’s second goal against England in the quarterfinals still stands as a shining example of what soccer is all about. In a span of four minutes the world saw the worst and best of Argentina’s ultimate sporting icon. While the “Hand of God” goal was the very definition of deceit, Maradona’s second goal, later dubbed “The Goal of the Century,” was pure poetry, affirmation of his genius and standing as the greatest player on the planet at the time.</dd><br><dt><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ccNkksrfls\">Diego Maradona - Hand of God(1986)</a><br>(Click to see Diego Maradona's goal!)</dt><br><dd>Racing England goalkeeper Peter Shilton for a ball that hung in the air, the Argentine trickster punched it into the net, expertly camouflaging his trickery and duping the linesman and referee by nodding his head as if he made contact with it. At the post-match press conference, a brazen Maradona claimed the goal was scored “a little bit by the Hand of God, another bit by the head of Maradona.” TV networks around the world showed the incident time and time again that evening, as Maradona’s “Hand of God” goal became enshrined in the sporting lexicon.</dd><br><dt><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Uhe_l1h3w8\">Geoff Hurst’s - Most Debated Right-Footed Goal(1966)</a><br>(Click me to watch why was this the most debated goal!)</dt><br><dd>No goal in the history of sport sparks as much controversy as Hurst’s game-winner against the West Germans in the final. In extra time, Hurst belted a furious right-footed shot that blazed past goalkeeper Hans Tilkowski, hit the underside of the crossbar and bounced down on the goal-line. Did the ball cross the line? Subsequent replays over the years show it did not, but when asked by Swiss referee Gottfried Dienst for a ruling, linesman Tofik Bakhramov, without hesitation, pointed his flag towards the centre circle on the field, signaling a goal. The Germans were livid, but England went on to win the World Cup</dd><br><dt><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKsMnEemzMM\">Pele and Carlos Alberto - The Burial of Italy (1970)</a><br>(Cick to see the highlights from this amazing game!)</dt><br><dd>The goal was symbolic of the attacking genius of the Brazilians who used spirit, guile and talent to vanquish the defensive Italians. It was memorable strike that capped off an emphatic 4-1 win for Brazil over Italy in the final. Pele started the move down the left side before drifting towards the middle. He found some open space and sensing Alberto was coming down the right side, he played a perfect square pass 25 yards from goal that Alberto lashed onto without breaking stride and hammered the ball past static Italian goalkeeper Enrico Albertosi. Legendary if you ask me.</dd><br><dt><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu1WanatiAM\">Uruguay silences the Maracana (1950)</a><br>(Click me to watch highlights from this game!)</dt><br><dd>Buoyed by the crowd of 174,000 spectators at Rio’s Maracana stadium on a rainy day, the invincible Brazilians were virtually assured of victory against Uruguay in the tournament finale. What’s more, Uruguay had tied Spain in its first game of the final round and trailed Brazil by a point. All the hosts had to do was earn a draw against Uruguay and Brazil would be crowned world champions. How could they lose? Thanks to a brave effort, Uruguay pulled out the victory in the 79th minute when Alcides Ghiggia played a 1-2 pass with Julio Perez and beat the Brazilian goalkeeper at the near post. When the final whistle blew, the stunned and silent Maracana crowd broke into tears.</dd><br><dt><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITdPTKpGHuI\">Zidane’s head-butt (2006)</a><br>(click the link to see this infamous head-but!)</dt><br><dd>This is one of those historical moments that was not even defined by a goal! With 10 minutes remaining in extra time of the final, Zinedine Zidane turned to face Marco Materazzi (who said something to tick off the French midfielder) and head-butted the Italian defender in the chest, knocking him to the ground and earning a red card for himself. Zidane’s act of lunacy cost France its best scorer in the shootout and Italy claimed its fourth World Cup title. A media feeding frenzy ensued – news agencies around the globe tried to find out what Materazzi said to set off Zidane – and the retiring Zizou left the game in disgrace.</dd><br></div><img src=\"Images/Players/-methode-times-prod-web-bin-db5889bc-be29-11e7-8bb9-94e1372175c0.jpg\" alt=\"World Cup\" width=\"600px\"></p>"
