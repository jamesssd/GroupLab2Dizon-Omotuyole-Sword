      <h2>Rules of the Game</h2>
      <a href='#r13'>Jump to Rule 13</h3></a>
      <li><b>The Field of Play</b></li>
      <ol type="i">
        <li>Soccer must be played on gross or artificial turf with proper regulation lengths.</li>
      </ol>     
      
      <li><b>The Ball</b></li>   
      <ol type="i">
        <li>A soccer ball must be spherical in shape and made of leather. The circumference must be in the range of 27 to 28 inches.</li> 
      </ol>
      
      <li><b>The Number of Players</b></li>    
      <ol type="i">
        <li>A match must be played by two teams of 11 players to each side. If a team cannot get at least seven players at match time, then that team will forfeit.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <li><b>The Player's Equipment</b></li>
      <ol type="i">
        <li>All players are required to wear a jersey, shorts, shin guards, socks and cleats. The socks must cover the shin guards entirely. If the referee deems a player’s equipment unsatisfactory, the player can be sent off until the issue is remedied.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <li><b>The Referee</b></li>
      <ol type="i">
        <li>The RefereeThe referee is the authority on the field, and his word is law. If you question a referee’s decision, you can be disciplined further simply for dissent.
        </li>
      </ol>
      
      <li><b>The Assistant Referees</b></li>
      <ol type="i">
        <li>The assistant referees are primarily responsible for assisting the referee in performing his duties – this includes signaling with a flag when a ball goes of play, when a player is fouled, or when a player is in an offside position.
        </li>
      </ol>
      
      <li><b>The Duration of the Match</b></li>
      <ol type="i">
        <li>A soccer match is comprised of two 45-minute halves, with extra time added for each at the referee’s discretion. The halves are separated by a half-time period not to exceed 15 minutes. The extra time generally corresponds with the referee’s determination of how much time was taken up due to substitutions and injuries. The amount of extra time is announced and displayed at the half line at the end of each 45-minute period. Although soccer does have an allotted time limit, it is ultimately up to the referee’s as to when to end a match.</li>
      </ol>

      <li><b>The Start and Restart of Play</b></li>
      <ol type="i">
        <li>Kick-off is generally determined by a coin toss, whereby the winning team can either choose to start with the ball or choose which goal they would like to attack. The losing team is then afforded whatever choice the winner does not elect to take. Kick-off occurs at the start of each half, and after each goal scored, and is taken at the center of the halfway line. If a team scores a goal, the opposing team is given the kick-off to restart the match.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <li><b>Ball In and Out of Play</b></li>
      <ol type="i">
        <li>The ball is out of play when it fully crosses either the goal line or the touch line. It is also out of play if the referee stops play for any reason. If, for any reason, the ball strikes the frame of the goal or the referee and remains within the goal and touch lines, it is still in play.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <li><b>The Method of Scoring</b></li>
      <ol type="i">
        <li>A goal is scored when the entire ball has crossed the goal line within the frame of the goal. At the end of the match, the team with the most goals is the winner, barring the circumstantial necessity for extra time.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <li><b>Offside</b></li>
      <ol type="i">
        <li>When an attacking player receives the ball while on his opponents half, he must be level or behind the second to last defender (the last typically being the goalkeeper). However, this rule only applies if he is involved with the play. To get a better understanding of the offside rule, please see the guide section for a more detailed explanation.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <li><b>Fouls and Misconduct</b></li>

        <li>Using offensive or abusive language and/or gestures</li>
        <li>Receiving a second caution (yellow card) in the same match</li>
      </ol>

      <li><b>Free Kicks</b></li>
      <ol type="i">
        <li>Free Kick is broken into two categories, direct and indirect. A direct kick can be shot directly into the opponent’s goal without touching another player. An indirect free kick is indicated by the referee raising his hand during the kick. An indirect kick can only go into the goal if it has subsequently been touched by another player before it enters the goal. The ball must be stationary for both types of kicks.</li>
      </ol>   

      <li><b>The Penalty Kick</b></li>
      <ol type="i">
        <li>A penalty kick is awarded either when a defensive player fouls an attacking player or commits a handball in his/her team’s penalty area. The penalty kick is placed at the penalty spot, and all players on both teams must remain outside the penalty box during the shot. They may enter the box immediately after the shot is taken. The goalkeeper may move horizontally along the goal line before the shot is taken, but he may not come off the line until the ball is struck.</li>
      </ol>

    <li><b>The Throw-In</b></li>
      <ol type="i">
        <li>A throw-in is awarded when the possessing team plays the ball out of bounds over the touchline. While taking a throw-in, a player must release the ball with both hands simultaneously and keep both feet firmly planted on the ground. If these conditions are not met, play is stopped and the throw-in is given to the opposing team. Players are not allowed to score directly off a throw-in.</li>
      </ol>
      
    <li><b>The Goal Kick</b></li>
      <ol type="i">
        <li>A goal kick is awarded when the offensive team plays the ball out of bounds over the defensive team’s goal line. After the ball is out of play, the defender or goalkeeper may place the ball anywhere within the six-yard goal box and kick the ball back into play.</li>
      </ol>

    <li><b>The Corner Kick</b></li>
      <ol type="i">
        <li>A corner kick is awarded to the offensive team when the defensive team plays the ball out of bounds over its goal line. The ball is placed within the corner area and is kicked back into play by the offensive team. Players can score directly off a corner kick.</li>
      </ol>
