      <h2>Rules of the Game</h2>
      <a href='#r10'>Jump to Rule 10</h3></a>
      <li><b>The Field of Play</b></li>
      <ol type="i">
        <li>Soccer must be played on gross or artificial turf with proper regulation lengths.</li>
      </ol>     
      
      <li><b>The Ball</b></li>   
      <ol type="i">
        <li>A soccer ball must be spherical in shape and made of leather. The circumference must be in the range of 27 to 28 inches.</li> 
      </ol>
      
      <li><b>The Number of Players</b></li>    
      <ol type="i">
        <li>A match must be played by two teams of 11 players to each side. If a team cannot get at least seven players at match time, then that team will forfeit.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <li><b>The Player's Equipment</b></li>
      <ol type="i">
        <li>All players are required to wear a jersey, shorts, shin guards, socks and cleats. The socks must cover the shin guards entirely. If the referee deems a player’s equipment unsatisfactory, the player can be sent off until the issue is remedied.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <li><b>The Referee</b></li>
      <ol type="i">
        <li>The RefereeThe referee is the authority on the field, and his word is law. If you question a referee’s decision, you can be disciplined further simply for dissent.
        </li>
      </ol>
      
      <li><b>The Assistant Referees</b></li>
      <ol type="i">
        <li>The assistant referees are primarily responsible for assisting the referee in performing his duties – this includes signaling with a flag when a ball goes of play, when a player is fouled, or when a player is in an offside position.
        </li>
      </ol>
      
      <li><b>The Duration of the Match</b></li>
      <ol type="i">
        <li>A soccer match is comprised of two 45-minute halves, with extra time added for each at the referee’s discretion. The halves are separated by a half-time period not to exceed 15 minutes. The extra time generally corresponds with the referee’s determination of how much time was taken up due to substitutions and injuries. The amount of extra time is announced and displayed at the half line at the end of each 45-minute period. Although soccer does have an allotted time limit, it is ultimately up to the referee’s as to when to end a match.</li>
      </ol>

      <li><b>The Start and Restart of Play</b></li>
      <ol type="i">
        <li>Kick-off is generally determined by a coin toss, whereby the winning team can either choose to start with the ball or choose which goal they would like to attack. The losing team is then afforded whatever choice the winner does not elect to take. Kick-off occurs at the start of each half, and after each goal scored, and is taken at the center of the halfway line. If a team scores a goal, the opposing team is given the kick-off to restart the match.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <li><b>Ball In and Out of Play</b></li>
      <ol type="i">
        <li>The ball is out of play when it fully crosses either the goal line or the touch line. It is also out of play if the referee stops play for any reason. If, for any reason, the ball strikes the frame of the goal or the referee and remains within the goal and touch lines, it is still in play.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <li id= "r10"><b>The Method of Scoring</b></li>
      <ol type="i">
        <li>A goal is scored when the entire ball has crossed the goal line within the frame of the goal. At the end of the match, the team with the most goals is the winner, barring the circumstantial necessity for extra time.</li>
      </ol>
